# Your assignment
The goals for this assignment are to:
- practice making maps with the various packages
- think about composition and the grammar of graphics
- critique various maps

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have several static maps displaying the datasets we've used in the last few weeks.

# Task 1: Show me your ugly maps!!
Find 2 examples of maps that you think are 'bad'. 

![bad map numeber one](~/R/assignment-08-KirstenFuller/code/bad_maps/bad map 1.jpg)

![bad map numero dos](~/R/assignment-08-KirstenFuller/code/bad_maps/bad map 2.jpeg)

_Question 1_ Why are they bad? What might improve them? 

_Question 2_ Rely on the Healy and Wilke texts to provide some structure to your answers.

# Task 2: Load your libraries and build a dataframe
You can choose whichever datasets you'd like from the past several months as the subject for your mapping. You'll need to use at least one tabular join, one spatial join, and one extraction to create the dataframe. Load the packages, the data, and make sure everything is projected here. Give me a sense for what you are hoping to map.

# LOAD PACKAGES:
```{r packages, include = FALSE}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(pander)
library(units)
library(ggmap)
library(cartogram)
library(patchwork)
library(tmap)
library(viridis)
library(tidyr)
```

# LOAD DATA:
```{r data}
session18_data <- list.files('/opt/data/session16', full.names = TRUE)
session18_data

protected_areas <- st_read('/opt/data/session16/reg_pas.shp')
mammal_raster <- terra::rast('/opt/data/session16/Mammals_total_richness.tif')
land_val_raster <- terra::rast('/opt/data/session16/Regval.tif')
pa_desig <- st_read('/opt/data/session04/regionalPAs1.shp')
```

# SPATIAL DEFINING:
```{r crs}
# check for valid geometry and make valid if necessary
all(st_is_valid(protected_areas)) # FALSE
protected_areas_val <- st_make_valid(protected_areas) # make it valid

all(st_is_valid(pa_desig)) # FALSE
pa_desig_val <- st_make_valid(pa_desig)

# check crs of shapefile objects
st_crs(protected_areas_val) # USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic_USGS_version 
st_crs(pa_desig_val) # USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic_USGS_version 

# check crs of raster objects
crs(land_val_raster) # NAD83 / Conus Albers\ 
crs(mammal_raster) # USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_conic

# REPROJECT RASTER:
# I will have to reproject one of the rasters so that they are in the same projection.
# check the extent to see which raster is larger, this will help us decide which raster to reproject.
terra::ext(mammal_raster)
terra::ext(land_val_raster)
# mammal raster is larger than the land value raster. Since we want to reproject the raster with the smaller extent, we will reproject the land value raster.
# reproject the land value raster to match the mammal raster
land_val_ras_proj <- project(land_val_raster, mammal_raster)

# check to see if they match now
crs(mammal_raster) == crs(land_val_ras_proj) # TRUE, they do match! 

# now we must transform the shapefiles to match the crs of the rasters
pa_reg_val_trans <- st_transform(protected_areas_val, crs = crs(mammal_raster))
pa_desig_val_trans <- st_transform(pa_desig_val, crs = crs(mammal_raster))
```

To make sure these data are all in the correct projections, I will plot them to make sure they align.
# CREATE SIMPLE PLOTS IN BASE R:
```{r plots}
# PLOT MAMMAL RAST:
# plot to see if the raster and the shapefile line up
plot(mammal_raster)
plot(pa_reg_val_trans, add = TRUE) # they do line up

# extract more information out of the data by catalyzing it
mammal_ras_cat <- catalyze(mammal_raster)
# plot it again to check it out
plot(mammal_ras_cat)

# looking at the above plots, we are only interested in [[2]]
mammal_ras_cat <- mammal_ras_cat[[2]]
# plot this again
plot(mammal_ras_cat)


# PLOT LAND VAL:
# plot the land value raster over the mammal raster
plot(mammal_ras_cat)
plot(land_val_ras_proj, add = TRUE) 
plot(pa_reg_val_trans, add = TRUE) # add the regions too, they all align.
```

# objects to use:
pa_reg_val_trans
pa_desig_val_trans
land_val_ras_proj
mammal_ras_cat

# TABULAR JOIN:
```{r tab join}
# define the column names in pa_reg_val_trans that we want to replace with the columns from pa_desig_val_trans so they align.
colnames(pa_reg_val_trans)[c(1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 22, 25)] <- colnames(pa_desig_val_trans)

# define the states in the west in an object
states <- c( "ID", "MT", "WY", "UT", "NV", "AZ", "NM", "CO" )

# define the gap sts we want in an object
GAP_sts <- c("1", "2", "3") 

# join the pa_desig_trans and the pa_regions_trans objects together 
pa_bind <- pa_reg_val_trans %>% 
  dplyr::select(colnames(pa_desig_val_trans)) %>% 
  bind_rows(pa_desig_val_trans, pa_reg_val_trans) %>%
  filter(., State_Nm %in% states, GAP_Sts %in% GAP_sts) %>%
  st_buffer(., 50000)

# subset the western states from the tigris package
west_states <- tigris::states(cb=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(STUSPS %in% states)

# Practice making a quick map with tmap. 
# make a plot with tmap of the states to start
tmap::qtm(west_states, fill = "NAME") +
  tm_text("NAME")

# check the object classes
class(west_states) # sf
class(pa_bind) # sf

# have to convert the pa_bind sf object and the west_states to spatvectors before we are able to crop them in terra
pa_bind_vect <- as(pa_bind, "SpatVector")
crs(pa_bind_vect) # check the crs: USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic

west_states_vect <- as(west_states, "SpatVector")
crs(west_states_vect) # check crs: NAD83, need to project
west_states_vect_proj <- terra::project(west_states_vect, mammal_raster)
# check the crs again to make sure it matches
crs(west_states_vect_proj) == crs(mammal_raster)

# crop the mammal richness raster and the land value raster to the extent of the western states vector
mam_rich_crop <- crop(mammal_ras_cat, west_states_vect_proj)
land_val_crop <- crop(land_val_ras_proj, west_states_vect_proj)

west_census_dat <- tidycensus:: get_acs(geography = "county", 
                                        variables = c(medianincome = "B19013_001", pop = "B01003_001"),
                                        state = states, 
                                        year = 2018,
                                        key = key,
                                        geometry = TRUE) %>% 
  st_transform(., crs(mammal_raster)) %>% 
  select(-moe) %>% 
  tidyr::spread(variable, estimate)

# join the pa areas and the census data
pa_summary <- st_join(st_as_sf(pa_bind_vect), west_census_dat, left = TRUE)

# group the data by unit and then summarise by mean medianincome 
pa_summary <- pa_summary %>% 
  group_by(Unit_Nm) %>% 
  summarize(., meaninc = mean(medianincome, na.rm=TRUE),
            meanpop = mean(pop, na.rm=TRUE))

# double check to see that I got the right number of rows
nrow(pa_summary) == length(unique(pa_bind$Unit_Nm)) # TRUE

# rasterize and extract data
pa_bind_rast <- terra::rasterize(pa_bind_vect, mam_rich_crop, field = "Unit_Nm")

# extract the data
mammal_zones <- terra::zonal(mam_rich_crop, pa_bind_rast, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
landval_zones <- terra::zonal(land_val_crop, pa_bind_rast, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
# Note that there is one few zone than we have in our PA dataset. This is because we have an overlapping jurisdicition; we'll ignore that now but it's a common problem with using the PADUS

# leftjoin all of this data together now
summary_join <- pa_summary %>% 
  left_join(., mammal_zones) %>%
  left_join(., landval_zones)
```


# Task 3: Build a map with Tmap
```{r}
# start with a simple tmap plot
tmap::tm_shape(summary_join) + # in tm_shape you define the data you want to plot
  tm_polygons(col = "Regval",  border.col = "white") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)

# then build a more advanced tmap
tm_shape(mam_rich_crop) +
  tm_raster("Value", palette = viridis(n=50), n=50, legend.show=FALSE, legend.hist = FALSE) + # plots species richness values
tm_shape(west_states) + # then plot the western states over the raster
  tm_borders("black", lwd = .75) + # define the border color
tm_shape(summary_join) + # add in the summarized protected area data 
  tm_polygons(col = "meanpop", palette = "Pastel1", border.col = "black", title = "Mean Population") + # specify that you want to plot the meanpop
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE) # address the legend here
```


# Task 4: Build a choropleth with ggplot
Your map should have a basemap, should rely on more than one aesthetic (color, transparency, etc), and combine multiple layers.
```{r}

```


# Task 5: Build 2 cartograms
Follow the examples to build cartograms that display your region of interest based on variables other than area.
```{r}

```


_Question 3:_ Reflect on the different maps you've made, what do the different visualizations tell you about the data you plotted?

_Question 4:_ How might you improve the maps you've made?

_Question 5:_ Is a map the best way to evaluate the data you worked with? Why or Why not?
